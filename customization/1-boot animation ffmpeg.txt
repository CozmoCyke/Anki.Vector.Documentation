I may have given you a little too many parameters on the original ffmpeg.  The rate probably isn't useful, and i may have been a bit glib/hand wavy with the reversing it command.  ffmpeg is a super great tool, but its command set is painfully non obvious.
I encoded the fun parts of the binary eyes:
ffmpeg  -f image2 -start_number 8 -i face_uperformance_binaryeyes_01_%04d.png -frames 282 -f rawvideo -pix_fmt rgb565 -video_size 184x96 test.raw
Then I reverse the process (to test it) by
mkdir test;cd test
ffmpeg -f rawvideo  -pixel_format rgb565 -video_size 184x96  -i "../test.raw"  boot_anim%03d.png

That appeared to work for me, in that the pix looked right. 
-aspect 1/1 -filter:v "crop=720:396:0:442,setsar=1,setdar=1"
-vf scale=184:96
