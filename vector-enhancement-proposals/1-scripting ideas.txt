Ideas on a scripting language for Vector behavior

When the user says $X-list
    $XList := $X
    $XList := $X ‘,’ $XList
    $X ::= intent name
    #X ::=’”’ phrase ‘”’ map to intent name

This could be a list of intents; mapped to a respondToUserIntents


    animations::= animation
    animations::=‘(‘ animation-list ‘)’
    animation-list := animation
    animation-list := animation ‘,’ animation-list

This produces a list of animation names

    rsequence::= randomized-animation
    rsequence::= randomized-animation ‘,’ rsequence
    randomized-animation ::=  [animations]{min,max}

the randomized-animation becomes a DancePhraseConfig
