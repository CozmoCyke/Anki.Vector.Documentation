# Whiskey

The “Whiskey” prototypes were  built from modified Vector hardware.  The key
change(s) are:

* The time of flight sensor was removed from the body-board
* Two time of flight sensors were placed on the head, on either side of the LCD
* The body-board layout was rearranged to better dissipate heat away from the battery.


By placing the time of flight sensors in the head, Whiskey could scan around more — moving the head up and down, as well as using a more sophisticated version of the time of flight sensor.  This would allow him to map the edges far better, as well as scan for objects and interesting things like hands and faces.

In some reports the idea was to use the changes to the TOF sensor placement for a next generation Cozmo design.  The project was cancelled before Anki’s demise.


These turn up from time to time on Ebay.
