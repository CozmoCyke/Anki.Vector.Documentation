- Body movements
- Eyes
- Colors?
- PNGs on face
- Backpack lights
- Cube lights
- Other custom animations

Or it might be physical changes, and tweaks that are distinctive and identify

## Customizing animations

- animation  of eyes
- body movements
- boot animation


People would love tools to gen the animation file… but I suspect that may be hard.

the export.. but since   Maya is expensive, and hard.. 

Maybe a Unity model tool could be made with a rigged model of Vector?
 and such for I suspect the value vs effort isn’t there for such a specialized area, but who knows?

Tools for generating animation files.

What about mixing-matching existing animations, and adjusting them slightly?

## Sounds

## Behavior tree crafting

## Body modifications
