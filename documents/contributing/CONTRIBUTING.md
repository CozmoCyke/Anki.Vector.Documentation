for all.  We love receiving contributions from our community, all contributions are welcome, including:

* issues (bug reports),
* new documents
* updates and tweaks,
* blog posts,
* workshops
* etc

There are many ways to contribute, including submitting bug reports, improving
documentation, submitting feature requests, reviewing new submissions, or
contributing bits that can be incorporated into the project.

## Not sure how to start contributing?

If you are worried or don't know where to start, 
you can reach out with questions to anyone from the
Project Victor team on

## Pair programming

Other projects offer free [pair programming sessions](https://gatsby.dev/contributing/pair-programming/)
to the community.  I think that might be a neat idea, if there's something
others would like to work on together......


## Code of Conduct

> By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct][0]. We expect all contributors to follow the [Code of Conduct][0] and to treat fellow humans with respect.


## Important Resources

The important documents and links are on the [front page of the wiki.](../index.md)

## Improving Documentation

If you have a suggestion for the documentation, I would recommend that you take
a stab at making the changes to the documentatin.

For large fixes, please build and test the documentation before submitting the
pull-request to be sure you haven't accidentally introduced any layout or
formatting issues.

### How to Create the HTML and PDF files

The source documentation text files can be found
[documents directory](./documents). The built out files will be placed within a
[site] directory.

First, install the documentation tools:

    pip3 install mkdocs-material
    pip3 install mkdocs-localsearch


Then you can build the html site simply by:

    mkdocs build

### Building a PDF file as well
You can also build the PDF.  First install the tools:

    pip3 install mkdocs-with-pdf

There is some further installation, see the following link for more details:
[https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-with-pdf/](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-with-pdf/)

Rename the "mkdocs.yml" file
Then rename "mkdocs-pdf.yml" to "mkdocs.yml"

To build is the same as before

    mkdocs build


### Whitespace Cleanup

Donâ€™t mix code or documentation changes with whitespace cleanup! If you are
fixing whitespace, include those changes separately from your code changes. If
your request is unreadable due to whitespace changes, it will be rejected.

> Please submit whitespace cleanups in a separate pull request.


## Pull Request Process

Do you have any labelling conventions?

Add notes for pushing your branch:

> When you are ready to generate a pull request, either for preliminary review, or for consideration of merging into the project you must first push your local topic branch back up to GitHub:

```
git push origin newfeature
```

Include a note about submitting the PR:

> Once you've committed and pushed all of your changes to GitHub, go to the page for your fork on GitHub, select your development branch, and click the pull request button. If you need to make any adjustments to your pull request, just push the updates to your branch. Your pull request will automatically track the changes on your development branch and update.

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

### Review Process

The process is likely to be lite for many changes.

Many pull requests are likely to open for several days, until the core team can apporve them in Github.
In some cases, multiple people will have the chance to review/comment. 


### Addressing Feedback

Once a PR has been submitted, your changes will be reviewed and constructive feedback may be provided. Feedback isn't meant as an attack, but to help make sure the highest-quality code makes it into our project. Changes will be approved once required feedback has been addressed.

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of files has changed, and that you need to update your fork so it's easier to merge.

To update your forked repository, follow these steps:

```
# Fetch upstream master and merge with your repo's master branch
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master

# If there were any new commits, rebase your development branch
git checkout newfeature
git rebase master
```

If too much code has changed for git to automatically apply your branches changes to the new master, you will need to manually resolve the merge conflicts yourself.

Once your new branch has no conflicts and works correctly, you can override your old branch using this command:

```
git push -f
```

Note that this will overwrite the old branch on the server, so make sure you are happy with your changes first!
